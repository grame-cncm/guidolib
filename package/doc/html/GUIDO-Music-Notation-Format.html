<H2>1 Introduction</H2>

The GUIDO Notation Format is a general purpose formal
language for representing score level music
in a platform independent, plain-text and human-readable
way. It is based on a conceptually  simple but
powerful formalism; its design concentrates on general
musical concepts (as opposed to notational, i.e, graphical
features). A key feature of the GUIDO design is adequacy,
which means that simple musical concepts should be
represented in a simple way and only complex notions
should require complex representations.

<P>
In the present version, GUIDO supports most of the
commonly used concepts of conventional music notation;
however, it is designed to be a flexible and easily
extendable open standard.
Various extensions of the Basic GUIDO Notation Format
include mechanisms for representing musical structure,
abstract scores, micro-tonal music, and
generalized timed events (for multi-media support).
These extensions will be specified in subsequent
versions of this document.

<P>
GUIDO has not been developed with a particular application
in mind but to provide an adequate representation formalism
for score-level music over a broad range of applications.
The intended application areas include
notation software, compositional and analytical systems
and tools, large musical databases, performance systems,
and music on the World Wide Web.

<P>
The GUIDO Notation Format has been developed
by Holger H. Hoos, Technical University of Darmstadt,
Germany and Keith Hamel, University of British Columbia
in Vancouver, Canada; some features are based on
discussions with Michael Fuhlbr&uuml;gge, Kai Flade,
Thomas Helbich and J&uuml;rgen Kilian.
It is named after Guido d'Arezzo (990-1050), a renowned
music theorist of his time and important contributor to
today's conventional musical notation (CMN). His
achievements include the perfection of
the staff system for music notation and the invention
of solmisation (solfege).

<P>
The GUIDO Notation Format is publicly and freely available;
it can and should be freely used for arbitrary scientific,
educational or commercial purposes. However, the
GUIDO Notation Format specification remains the intellectual
property of the authors of this document. It is our
wish that every publicly available software supporting GUIDO
and every extension of GUIDO as specified in this document
should be brought to our attention.

<A NAME=basic></A>
<H2>2 Basic GUIDO Notation</H2>

Basic GUIDO Notation covers the representation of notes,
rests, accidentals, single- and multi-voiced music and
the most common concepts from conventional music notation
such as clefs, meter, key, slurs, ties, beaming,
stem directions, etc.


<A NAME=notes></A>
<H3>2.1 Notes and Rests</H3>

The general syntax for representing notes is

<P>
  <I>notename accidentals octave duration</I>

<P>
the corresponding represention for rests is

<P>
  <I>'_' duration</I>

<P>
Both notes and rests are instances of
GUIDO events; in particular, rests are treated as
special notes, which have a duration but neither
accidentals nor an octave value.

<P>
Octave and duration can be omitted; if so, they are inferred from preceeding
notes (or rests) within the same sequence or chord (for details, see
below) or assumed to have standard values (see below)
when required (such as for musical playback or notation).


<H4>2.1.1 Notenames</H4>

There are different systems of notenames:

<OL>
<LI>  c d e f g a h/b           <I>(diatonic)</I>
<LI>  c cis d dis e f fis g gis a ais h/b   <I>(chromatic)</I>
<LI>  do re me fa sol la si/ti        <I>(solfege)</I>
</OL>

<P>
<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> Arbitrarily mixing these systems is possible, but discouraged
<LI> h and b denote the same pitch-class (<I>b</I> being 
  used in the international  system, <I>h</I> in the 
  german system).
<LI> si and te denote the same pitch-class (<I>si</I> 
  being used in the
  french and italian, <I>ti</I> in the english solfege system).
</UL>


<H4>2.1.2 Accidentals</H4>

<I>accidentals</I> is an arbitrary sequence of the symbols
  '#' and '&amp;' (for sharp and flat); in particular, '##' is a double
sharp, '&amp;&amp;' a double flat.

<P>
<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> Accidentals cannot be used with rests.
<LI> Accidentals are valid only for the note in the description of
  which the appear.
<LI> The usage of arbitrary sequences of accidentals without a
  reasonable interpretation in CMN (such as #&amp;#)
  is discouraged.
<LI> Chromatic pitch-classes are assumed to be different from
  alterated diatonic ones, i.e., c# != cis.
</UL>


<H4>2.1.3 Octave</H4>

<I>octave</I> is an integer number indicating the octave of the note, where
a1 is the 440Hz <I>a</I>.
All octaves start with the 
pitch-class <I>c</I>, so <I>c1</I> is the <I>c</I> just 
below <I>a1</I>.


<P>
<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> The usage of octaves beyond the range of -3..+5 is discouraged.
<LI> If <I>octave</I> is omitted from a note description,
  it is assumed to be identical to the last octave specified
  before in the current sequence.
<LI> <I>octave</I> should always be specified at the beginning of
  each sequence; if this is not done, but an octave is
  required in the context of an application,
  a standard value of +1 is to be assumed.
</UL>


<H4>2.1.4 Duration</H4>

<I>duration</I> is specified in one of the forms

<OL>
<LI> <I>'*'enum'/'denom dotting</I>
<LI> <I>'*'enum dotting</I>
<LI> <I>'/'denom dotting</I>
</OL>

where <I>enum</I> and <I>denom</I> are positive integers and <I>dotting</I>
is either empty, '.', or '..'; if no dots are present, the relative duration of the notes is assumed to be

<UL>
<LI>  <I>enum</I>/<I>denom</I> beats in case (1);
<LI>  <I>enum</I>/1 beats in case (2);
<LI>  1/<I>denom</I> in case (3).
</UL>

Succeeding the duration by
<UL>
<LI> one dot '.' is equivalent to multiplying it by 3/2
<LI> two dots '..' is equivalent to multiplying it by 7/4
</UL>

<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> Triplets are represented as *1/3, *1/6, ...; quintuplets, septuplets
  and so on are handled analogously.
<LI> Durations which are specified by fractions that are equal, such as
  *2/4 and *1/2, are considered to be different.
<LI> Although dotted durations have equivalent dot-less durations, these are
  considered to be different (*1/4. is not identical to *3/8).
<LI> If <I>duration</I> is omitted from a note description,
  it is assumed to be identical to the last duration specified
  before in the current sequence.
<LI> <I>duration</I> should always be specified at the beginning of
  each sequence; if this is not done, but a duration is
  required in the context of an application,
  a standard value of 1/4 is to be assumed.
</UL>

<I>General remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> No white space (blank, newline or tab) should be used within note
  descriptions.
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<!-- jk correctet c2&&/2. and fa1## into c&&2/2. fa##1  12.1.2004 -->
<PRE>
  d1*3/4
  c#-1/8

</PRE>
<BR>


<HR>

<A NAME=tags></A>
<H3>2.2 Tags and Tagged Ranges</H3>

Tags are used to represent additional musical information, such as slurs,
clefs, keys, etc. A tag has one of the forms

<OL>
<LI> <I>'\'id</I>
<LI> <I>'\'id'&lt;'param-list'&gt;'</I>
<LI> <I>'\'id'(' note-series ')'</I>
<LI> <I>'\'id'&lt;'param-list'&gt;' '(' note-series ')'</I>
</OL>

where
<UL>
<LI> <I>id</I> is one of a number of predefined tag-names (see
  section 2.7 below),
<LI> <I>arg-list</I> is a list of string or numerical arguments,  separated
  by commas (','),
<LI> <I>note-series</I> is a series of note descriptions (as defined above) 
  or chord descriptions (see Section 2.4) and tags
  separated by white space (spaces, newlines, and/or tabs).
</UL>

<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> In general, tag-structures can be arbitrarily nested, since the
  <I>note-series</I> in (3) and (4) may contain other tags.
<LI> The tags which are defined in Basic GUIDO are described in detail
  in section 2.7 (see below).
<LI> Tags of the from (1) and (2) are used for elements of CMN like
  clefs, meter, key, etc.
<LI> Tags of the from (3) and (4) are called tagged ranges,
  they define properties of series of notes such as slurs, beams, etc.
<LI> Generally, tags have no duration; however, tagged ranges can be thought
  of extending over the duration of the note series they are associated
  with.
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
  \bar  % barline
  \clef<"g2"> % treble clef
  \slur(c1/4 d e) % slurred group
  \label<"motive A">(g1/2 f#/4 g g#/2)  % named sequence
</PRE>
<BR>


<HR>

<A NAME=seq></A>
<H3>2.3 Note Sequences</H3>

A note sequence is of the form

<I>'[' tagged-notes ']'</I>

where <I>tagged-notes</I> is a series of notes, tags, and tagged
ranges separated by white space. Note sequences represent single-voiced scores.

<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> If duration or octave values are omitted for notes within a
  sequence, they are assumed to be equal to the last
  value specified in the current sequence.
<LI> Duration and octave values should be specified at the
  beginning of each sequence; if this is not done,
  they are assigned standard default values (see above) when
  this is required in the context of an application (such as
  playback or notation software).
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
  [ a1*1 ]      % single note
  [ c1/4 d e f g a h c2/2 ] % C major scale

  % short motive with meter, barlines and a slur:
  [\meter<"4/4"> f0/4 \bar c1/2 \slur(e&amp;/4 c) \bar g/2]
</PRE>
<BR>


<HR>

<A NAME=ch></A>
<H3>2.4 Chords and Chord Sequences</H3>

A chord is denoted by

<I> '{' note-list '}' </I>

where <I>note-list</I> is a list of (possibly tagged) notes
separated by commas.

<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>

<LI> All notes of a chord should have the same duration.
<LI> If this is not the case, the duration of the chord is

    the duration of the longest note within the chord; all other

    notes are interpreted as being succeeded by rests which
    compensate for the difference between their duration and
    that of the chord.
<LI> The notes within a chords do not have to be ordered


    with respect to  their pitch; however, it is suggested
    to consistently order chords in either an ascending or
    descending fashion.

<LI> If for some note of a chord, duration or octave values are
    omitted, these are assumed to be equal to the last
    respective value specified in the current sequence;
    this applies also to the case where
    this value was specified for a preceeding note of the same
    chord.
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
  {c1/4., e&amp;1/4., g1/4.}  % c minor triad , ascending order
  {c1/4.,e&amp;,g}      % same as above, abbreviated notation
  {c#1/4,e#,g#}     % C-sharp major triad, ascending order
  {c2, dis1, ais0, fis}   % four-voice chord, descending order
</PRE>
<BR>


<H4>Chord Sequences</H4>

A chord sequence is a generalised note sequence, where instead
of individual notes, chords may also appear.

<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> Chord sequences may contain chords as well as notes and rests.
<LI> The chords within a sequence need not all have the same number
    of notes.
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
  [ {c1/4,e,g} {c,f,a} {d,f,h} {c1/2,g1,c2} ] % progression of triads
  [ _/8 \slur(c1 d e) {fis/2, ais} e/2 ]    % mixed notes and chords
</PRE>
<BR>


<HR>

<A NAME=segm></A>
<H3>2.5 Note Segments</H3>

Note segments represent multi-voiced scores; they are denoted
by

<I> '{' seq-list '}' </I>

where <I>seq-list</I> is a list of note sequences separated by
commas. It is assumed that all voices start
simultaneously. Normally, the sequences should have equal
durations; if this is not the case, the duration of the segment
is the duration of the longest voice within the segment; all other
voices are interpreted as if they were succeeded by additional
rests which compensate for the difference between their
duration and that of the segment.


<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI> The voices within a segment don't have to be ordered
  according to their pitch-range; however, it is recommended
  that voices be specified in either an ascending or a descending
  order with respect to  their compass.
<LI> Octave and duration values should be specified at the
  beginning of each voice; if this is not done, default values
  will be assumed when required in the context of
  a specific application. In particular, octave and duration values
  don't carry over from one voice to the next.
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
  { [a0/4 h \slur(c1/8 h0) a/4],    % first voice
    [c1/4 d e/2],         % second voice
    [e1/8. \slur(f/16 e/8) d c h0 a/4] }  % third voice
</PRE>
<BR>


<HR>

<A NAME=cmnt></A>
<H3>2.6 Comments and Spacing</H3>

White space, i.e, any combination of
blank-, newline-, or tab-characters, can be inserted
everywhere except within note- or tag-names. The use of
white space is discouraged in the following
situations:

<UL>
<LI> within note specifications
<LI> between tag-names and tag-argument-lists
</UL>

White space is required in the following instances:

<UL>
<LI> between notes
<LI> between tags
<LI> between notes and tags and vice versa
</UL>


<H4>Comments</H4>

Comments can be inserted everywhere where white space is
allowed. A comment is preceeded by '%' and extends to the
end of the line it started in. Thus, lines beginning with
'%' are comment-lines.

Alternately, '(*' <I>comment</I> '*)' can be used for
specifying comments. This form of comments can include
multiple lines and may be nested.

<P>
<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
% a comment-line

a0/4 h \slur(c1/8 h0) % a/4 <-- the last note is commented out

[ c1/4   (* comment starts here ...
  d e f  <-- part of the comment!
  ... ends here *) d ]   % the sequence has only two notes!
</PRE>
<BR>


<HR>

<A NAME=stdtags></A>
<H3>2.7 Standard Tags</H3>

</DL>



<I>Remarks:</I>

<UL>
<LI>The \intens tag is associated with the metrical position
  of the note immediately following it and carries
  to the next dynamic marking.
<LI>The <I>s</I> parameter is a string containing a dynamic
  marking like "f", "p", "mf", "fp", etc; it is
  recommended to use only markings from conventional
  music notation.
<LI>For crescendos and diminuendos the appropriate tags
  and parameters should be used,
  using \cresc for representing diminuendos or \dim
  for crescendos should be avoided.
<LI>For longer crescendo or diminuendo sections
  the \crescBegin and \crescEnd or the
  \dimBegin and \dimEnd tag combinations should be
  used; this applies also for situations, where
  the crescendo or diminuendo section overlaps
  with other tagged ranges such as slurs.
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
[ \intens<"mf"> c2/2 \intens<"pp"> d1/2] % dynamic markings

<I>Remarks:</I>

<UL>
<LI>The \tempo tag is associated with the metrical position
  of the note immediately following it and carries
  to the next tempo indication.
<LI>The <I>s</I> parameter is a string containing a tempo
  indication like "Andante", "Allegro", "Fast", etc;
  it is recommended to use only markings from conventional
  music notation.
<LI>For accelerandos and ritardandos the appropriate tags
  and parameters should be used,
  using \accel for representing ritardandos or \rit
  for accelerandos should be avoided.
<LI>For longer accelerando or ritardando sections
  the \accelBegin and \accelEnd or the
  \ritBegin and \ritEnd tag combinations should be
  used; this applies also for situations, where
  the accelerando or ritardando section overlaps
  with other tagged ranges such as slurs.
</UL>

<H4>2.7.17 Beams</H4>

<DL>
<DT>\beamsAuto
<DD> sets beaming to automatic mode; automatic beaming
  usually depends on the meter.

<DT><BR>

<DT>\beamsOff
<DD> switches beaming off, i.e., only explicitly beamed
  notes will be beamed.

<DT><BR>

<DT>\beam(<I>notes</I>)
<DD> beam <I>notes</I>; can be nested to enforce non-standard
  beam groupings.

<DT><BR>

<DT>\bm(<I>notes</I>)
<DD> shorthand for \beam(<I>notes</I>)

<DT><BR>

<DT>\beam&lt;<I>dy1</I>,<I>dy2</I>&gt;(<I>notes</I>)
<DD> same as \beam(<I>notes</I>), but specifies the
  beam to begin <I>dy1</I> half-spaces above
  (or below, depending on the sign) the first note
  and to end <I>dy2</I> half-spaces above (or below)
  the last note; 
  the stem lengths are automatically 
  adjusted accordingly.

<DT><BR>

<DT>\bm&lt;<I>dy1</I>,<I>dy2</I>&gt;(<I>notes</I>)

<DD> shorthand for beam&lt;<I>dy</I>,<I>dy</I>&gt;(<I>notes</I>).
</DL>

<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI>\beam tags always override \beamsAuto or \beamsOff;

<LI>If \beam tags are not nested to account for each level of
  beaming, beams are assumed to be grouped according to
  standard rules;
<LI>If \beam tags with explicit beam positions are used
  for multiple beams, all the beams are assumed to be
  parallel with a standard distance from one another
  and the beam positions refer to the toplevel beam;
<LI>Rests can be included in the range of \beam tags,
  in this case they are assumed to be parted of the beamed
  structure.

<LI>The position parameters {\it dy1,dy2} are 
  floating point numbers in standard (not scientific!) notation
  or integer numbers; the reference position is at the
  center of the notehead; the stem lengths are automatically 
  adjusted accordingly.
</UL>

<I>Examples:</I>
<PRE>
[ \beam(d1/16 e c/8) \beamsOff d e ]  % beams the first group, while the last two eigth notes are not beamed
[ \beamsOff \beam(d1/16 e c/8) d e ]  % equivalent to the above
[ \beam( \beam(d1/16 e) \beam(c d))]  % explicitly group the 1/16th in 2+2

<A NAME=stems></A>
<H4>2.7.18 Stems</H4>

<DL>
<DT>\stemsAuto
<DD> sets the stem direction to auto mode, i.e., notes

<I>Remarks:</I>
<UL>
<LI>These tags determine the stem direction from where they
  occur to the next occurrence of a \stems* tag or the

<LI>The stem directions inferred for \stemAuto depend on
  the current clef;
<LI>If no \stems* tag is specified, \stemAuto is assumed.

<LI>If \meter information is present,
  explicit barlines can be used to enforce incomplete
  measures.
<LI>If \meter information is not present,
  barlines can be used to place arbitrary barlines.
<LI>Double barlines should only be explicitly specified
  if their usage cannot be inferred from the context
  such as for key and meter changes.
<LI>Tactus strokes are used to indicates

<LI>Marks can be used for various purposes such as
  representing rehearsal numbers, optically marking
  chords or notes, and acoustically marking time
  positions; their actual usage depends on the specific software
  supporting GUIDO.
<LI>Labels can be used to mark a whole piece (segment or sequence),
  in which case they
  should appear at the beginning of the first voice.
  Furthermore they can be used to mark arbitrary sections
  within a piece. This can be used to indicate
  motives, themes, or other analytical information.

<A NAME=adv></A>
<H2>3 Advanced GUIDO Notation</H2>
<p>
Advanced GUIDO Notation covers some of the more advanced
concepts not covered in Basic GUIDO Notation such as
glissando, arpeggio, clusters, microtonal alterations,
different types of noteheads, different types of staves,
and many features from contemporary notation.
It also addresses issues of advanced score setting such
as exact spacing and positioning of notation and graphical
elements.
</p>

<p>
Advanced GUIDO Notation will be realised
by an extended set of standard tags; the specification
is currently under development and will be available soon.
</p>

<HR>

<A NAME=ext></A>
<H2>4 Extended GUIDO Notation</H2>
<p>
Extended GUIDO Notation includes various features which
extend Basic and Advanced GUIDO Notation beyond
conventional music notation (CMN).
Some of these features are generic pitch-classes,
microtonal tuning systems and exact timing,
generic tone descriptions, abstract and hierarchical scores,
generalized events and user-defined tags.
</p>

<p>
Extended GUIDO Notation will be realised
by introducing an extended set of event types;
the specification
is currently under development and will be available soon.
</p>
