Welcome to the Guido project
======================================================================

[Grame](http://www.grame.fr) - Centre National de Création Musicale
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Guido project is an open source project that encompasses a music notation format, a score rendering engine and various music score utilities. The Guido Notation Format is a general purpose formal language for representing score-level music in a platform-independent plain text and human readable way. The format comes with various software components for music score rendering and manipulation. The main of these components is the Guido Engine, a library embedable in various platforms and using different programming languages.

The Guido engine runs on the main operating systems: Linux, MacOS, iOS, Windows, Android.

See [Guido page](http://guidolib.sourceforge.net/) for more information.

See [Guido wiki](https://github.com/grame-cncm/guidolib/wiki) for building instructions.

Binary distributions are available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/guidolib/files/
