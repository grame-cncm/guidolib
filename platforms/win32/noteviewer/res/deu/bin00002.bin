Important Notice
================

By downloading the installation package or using the
software, you acknowlegde having read and understood
the information given under Section "Copyright and
Disclaimer" of this documents. Please read that section 
carefully before you proceed with the installation
of the GUIDO NoteViewer. 


Updating old versions (0.1,0.1b,0.2,0.3, or 0.6a)
===================================

If you would like to replace an older version of the
GUIDO NoteViewer with the current version, it is
strongly recommended to FIRST UNINSTALL the previous 
version! Alternativly, you can install the new version 
into a new directory. 
Please make sure, that you save any changes to the 
example-files in the examples-directory of the previous
version, as they will be removed by the uninstall-procdure.


What's new in Release 0.6a
============================

Release 0.6a of the GUIDO NoteViewer presents the following
new features:

* support of a large number of Advanced GUIDO Tags
  allowing exact score-formatting
* new examples demonstrating the new features
* MIDI Playback and Export


Introduction
============

The GUIDO NoteViewer is a tool to display and print musical 
scores, that are written in GUIDO Music Notation.
The GUIDO NoteViewer is running under Windows 95 
or Windows NT 4.0 (or higher versions). 
GUIDO Music Notation is a textbased, humanreadable format 
to represent music. It is intended to describe musical 
information as well as notational information. In GUIDO, 
simple music can be described in a simple way, whereas 
complex music sometimes requires more complex representations.

System Requirements and Installation
====================================

GUIDO NoteViewer, Version 0.6a needs a PC with 
Windows 95 or Windows NT, 4.0 (or higher Versions). 
It runs fine on 80486-Processors (or better) with at least 16 MB.
To install the GUIDO NoteViewer, execute "gmninst.exe" 
and follow the given instructions. 


Getting Help and Reporting Bugs
===============================

GUIDO NoteViewer, Version 0.6a is still a prototype. Not all of the 
GUIDO Specification is supported yet (See sections 
"Supported GUIDO Tags" and "Not yet supported GUIDO Tags"). 
If you need help or would like to report a bug 
(greatly appreciated!), please send email to

renz@noteserver.org

or send a fax to

+49-6151-166185 

Please try to describe the bug as precise as possible. 


Features present in this version
================================

* support of a large number of Advanced GUIDO tags
* playback of GUIDO files using MIDI
* export of GUIDO files to MIDI files
* Justified margins and spacing using a spring-rod-model
* Display and printing of GUIDO files using arbitrary
  zoom-factors.
* Examples of GUIDO files in the example-directory
* Many of the Basic GUIDO tags are supported.
* You can view and edit the GUIDO Music Description
  by using "View -> Edit GMN-Text" or by pressing
  Ctrl-E when viewing a file.
  The GUIDO-Text is displayed and you can edit it.
  If you press the "Accept"-button, your changes
  are regonized and the piece is drawn anew. 
  When the view-window is closed you are asked whether
  you want to save the changes. You can also save
  your changes by using the File -> Save Menu or by
  pressing Ctrl-S.
* EPS-output (Encapsulated Postscript) is available
  (as an alpha-version). Use "Save as" and select
  the correct-file-type.


Supported GUIDO Tags (Basic GUIDO)
===================================

\intens<s>, \i<s>, \intens<s,r>, \i<s,r>
	indicates a dynamic marking s 
	r is ignored for graphical output.
	supported for s in: "p","f","ff","fff",
		"ffff","mf","mp","sf","pp","ppp","pppp"

\cresc(notes) 
	indicates an unspecific crescendo on notes. 
	Supported (no collision detection yet)

\cresc<s>(notes), \cresc<s,r>(notes)
	indicates a crescendo starting from the 
	current dynamic marking to dynamic 
	marking s on notes. r is ignored.
	Supported for s like the Parameter for \intens<s>

\crescBegin, \crescBegin<s>, \crescBegin<s,r>
	indicates the beginning of a crescendo section which ends 
	at the next \crescEnd tag; the crescendo starts 
	from the current dynamic marking. 

\crescEnd 
	indicates the end of an unspecific crescendo 
	section which began at the last \crescBegin tag. 

\dim(notes) 
	indicates an unspecific diminuendo on notes. 

\dim<s>(notes)m \dim<s,r>(notes) 
	indicates a diminuendo starting from the 
	current dynamic marking to dynamic marking s 
	on notes. 
	Parameter r is ignored when present.
	Supported for s like \intens<s>.

\dimBegin, \dimBegin<s>, \dimBegin<s,r> \dimEnd
	as \crescBegin etc.

\tie(notes)
	Ties the notes with a tie. (see file 
	tie.gmn in the examples-directory)

\slur(notes), \sl(notes)
	slur encompassing the group notes. The
	shape of the slur is determined by the
	stem-direction of the first note of
	the group.

\slur<dx1,dy1, dx2,dy2,h,r3>(notes) or
\sl<dx1,dy1, dx2,dy2, h,r3>(notes) 
	three-control-point bezier slur encompassing 
	notes; 
	
\fermata 
	indicates a fermata at the current metric position 
	(for use between notes)
	Spacing is not yet optimized.

\fermata(notes) 
	indicates fermatas for all notes 

\clef<s> 
	sets clef s, where s is a string indicating the 
	form of the clef ("g","f","c")
	and the position within the staff 
	("1" for lowest line, ..., "5" for highest 
	line). Optionally, this can be succeeded by 
	"+8","-8", "+15","-15" for transposed clefs 
	(octave or double octave up or down). 
	Also supported are "violin","bass","alto",
	"tenor". See file clef.gmn in the examples
	directory.
	
\meter<s> 
	sets time signature to s, where s is of the form "n/m" 
	for positive integers n,m. 
	Also allowed for s is "C" or "C/".

\key<i> 
	sets key signature to i sharps, if i is positive, 
	to |i| flats, if i is negative. 
	For i=0, the key signature contains no sharps or flats. 

\key<s> 
	indicates a key of s, where s is of the form 
	"n", "n#" or "n&" for any note name n. 
	Uppercase and lowercase letters are used to denote 
	major and minor modes, respectively. 
	(Example \key<"A"> and \key<3> is equivalent).
	Also supported is a free keysignature. See 
	key.gmn in the example directory for this.

\staff<i> 
	assigns the voice it appears in to staff number i 
	\staff<str> is not yet supported.
	See file choral.gmn in the example-Directory
	for the usage of the staff-Tag.
	There is no automatic collision-detection yet!

\beamsAuto 
	sets beaming to automatic mode; 
	automatic should depend on the meter (not
	yet implemented in this way).

\beamsOff 
	switches beaming off, i.e., only explicitly 
	beamed notes will be beamed. 

\beam(notes) , \bm(notes)
	beam notes; 
	no nested beams are yet supported.
	\beam<dy1,dy2>(notes) is not yet supported!
	
\stemsAuto 
	sets the stem direction to auto mode, 
	i.e., notes have downward stems if they are 
	lower than the 3rd line (if any), upward 
	stems otherwise. 

\stemsUp 
	sets stem directions to upward mode, i.e, all 
	stems are drawn upwards. 

\stemsDown 
	sets stem directions to downward mode, i.e, 
	all stems are drawn downwards. 

\stemsOff
	turns the stems off. (Graphical)

\bar, '|', \bar<i>
	indicates a barline at the position where it occurs. 
	'|' is not yet supported.
	The Parameter i is ignored.

\text<s>, \t<s>, \text<s,dy>, \t<s,dy>
	places text s at current metric position 
	If dy is specified. The text appears dy
	halfspaces above (positive value) or below
	(negative value) the lowest staff-line.
	CAREFUL, dy-Interpretation changed!

\repeatBegin
	Places a repeat-Begin-sign at the current position

\repeatEnd, \repeatEnd<n>( )
 	places a repeat-End-sign at the current position.
	If the second form is used, a repeat-end-sign is
 	placed at the end of the range (iff n == 1).
	This will be improved in later versions.

\tempo
\stacc(notes) 
\accent(notes) 
\ten(notes) 
\marcato(notes)
