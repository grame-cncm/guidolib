	- Beaming adjustement on stems seems to be better, but is still not perfect.
	- Fixed the beaming direction bug.
	- New Guido Engine entry points, renamed a few others. 
	- Reference counter mechanism for AR structures, so that several GR structure can 
	be linked to the same AR.  More flexibility for AR and GR structures manipulation. 
	See GUIDOEngine.h for more details.

2003-11-26 Jerome Berthet & Stephane Letz

Implement tempo indications. They can be of 3 types :

	- Textual only like \tempo<"Allegro"> . It will be displayed as a string.

	- BPM like \tempo<"Allegro", "1/4=120">. The string is displayed followed
	by a note and the bpm value.

	- Note equivalence like \tempo<"Allegro", "1/4=1/8">.
	The string is displayed followed by a note = another note.

Modified files : ARTempo.h, cpp, GRTempo.h,cpp

- MacOS-X multi-documents application that renders gmn files using Quartz, 
 without using the powerplant framework nor wxWindows.

- The wxWindows application "wxGuidoViewer", when compiled on Windows, now uses 
the native GDeviceWin32 graphic device. The wxWindows GDeviceWx is unable to
scale characters (i.e: the accolade), so the score rendering can be somewhat ugly.

- Introduced new VGDevices methods: DrawSymbol() and GetSymbolExtent(), that take 
a (int symbolID) as a parameter, instead of (const char * s, int inCharCount) 
strings. They are now free to map this symbolID to they want: a function call, a glyph
 from a musical font, a bitmap...

- GuidoLib do not use PrintAt() and Text-related functions anymore to display 
musical glyphs, it uses the new "Symbol" functions.
	
- Improved graphic devices classes. Common behavior and members are now 
shared among all devices classes via their VGDevice base class.

- Removed most of (all?) hard-coded Scriabin musical font character constants
from GuidoLib classes. Now, each musical symbol is defined by a MusicalSymbolID 
constant, which no longer has to match a glyph character code in a given musical Font.
Those new constants are stored in MusicalSymbols.h

- There is now 3 different methods for GRStaff to draw the staff lines:
	- The original one, that repeats drawing the staff char as many times 
	 as needed to complete the staff.
	- One that only draws one char per staff, after an appropriate scale
	  of the graphic context.
	- One that simply draws lines, with vector graphics functions.

- A new GuidoFactory API. It allows to build an abstract representation (AR)
 manually (that is, without the parser). I've split and added several functions
in GUIDOEngine.cpp, (I also did some code factorization), so it's now simpler and
easier to use and to understand.

- Every color attributes inside the GuidoLib are now coded as RGBA, where A is
the transparency (alpha) component. So it's possible, in theory, to draw 
semi-transparent or invisible symbols on the score. This feature is not (yet?) 
a part of the Guido Music Notation language specifications, so the behavior of 
Guido parsers is still undefined if they encounter a RGBA tag, instead of the 
traditional RGB one.

- Almost everything is ready, inside the Guido sources, to move coordinates
variables from long to float. Deep-internal calculations are already processed
using float values. Other coordinate-related parts of Guido now use the 
"GCoord" type, which is currently defined as a long. It will become a
float when we decide to move everything to floats.

- Sources are now cleaner and more readable. I've also added Doxygen-style comments, 
removed type conversions, removed useless #includes, replaced divisions by
multiplications equivalents, renamed class members variables with a leading 'm', 
replaced a few int by bool, removed too heavy inlines. The library compiles faster.

- The library no longer draws the white background of pages. Client applications
must draws their own background.

- New GUIDOEngine functions: GuidoUpdateGRMusic(), GuidoUpdateAllGRMusics()
- Renamed GuidoParse3() into GuidoParseFileForAR()
- Renamed GuidoGetNumPages() into GuidoPageCount()
- Renamed GuidoGetPixelSize() into GuidoConvertToDeviceUnits()
- Renamed GuidoGetVirtualSize() into GuidoConvertToVirtualUnits()

- added unicode support for .gmn files created by the Sibelius2GUIDO
  Plugin into guido.cpp. Such a unicode file will be converted into
  std. text file before parsing the content.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2003-05-09 Juergen Kilian

- added macos/applications/Guido2Midi/Guido2Midi.pbproj for
  a macos gmn2midi application
- added linux/applications/Guido2Midi/makefile for
  a linux gmn2midi application
- removed an ugly bug in Gmn2MidiParser.cpp::static short note2pcTable
- added Reload Menu Item to wxGuidoViewer

----------------------------------------------------------------
2003-05-05 Juergen Kilian

- parser didn't accept multiple tags inside chords 
[ c \tieBegin d {d \tieEnd, \tieBegin e} e \tieEnd]
- updated parser_t.c and lexy.c

----------------------------------------------------------------
2003-03-19 Jerome Berthet

- I had many problems with characters encoding between mac, windows
  and wxWindows. Currently, 10 music symbols are concerned (char 
  greater than 127). I've solved those problems with a dirty
  hack: Mac-Quartz and Mac-wxWindows versions need a FontEncodingConverter, 
  that uses Apple APIs for character encoding conversion.
- Removed callstru file. Replaced by GuidoOnDrawDesc.
- MacOS X Quartz implementation of GDevice.
- wxWindows implementation of GDevice.
- std c++ console version of GuidoFeedback (GuidoFeedbackStd.h)
- Removed some unnecessary #include, fixed some warnings under gcc.

Doxygen based documentation of lib-score-engine abstract and graphic classes.
The Score_Engine_Doxyfile can be used to generate a documentation in HTML format. 
Doxygen can be found here : http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

- GuidoOnDraw() no more draws as many score pages as it can, but
only the one given by callstruct.page.
- Clients can specify the name of text and music fonts to use.
- Simpler GDevice coordinates system.
- wxWindows implementation.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2003-02-05 Jerome Berthet

- Removed all win32 dependencies. and most of non-portable stuff. 
- Use of c++ standard headers, keywords and assert().
- Fixed some warnings on Metrowerks codewarrior compiler.
- The lib-score-engine now compiles on MacOS X.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2003-01-30 Jerome Berthet

- Definition of error codes constants. Many Guido APIs have 
changed and now return those new error codes.

- New API: int GuidoInit( GuidoInitDesc * );
It must be called at least one time before the first call of 
GuidoParse. Client applications can now provide a Graphic Device
object and a Feedback object to GuidoInit. The GuidoEngine 
will then uses those objects for all Graphic-related and user-feedback
operations. GuidoInit returns an error code.

- Guido font is no more loaded dynamically in the system, because
this is a too platform-dependant feature. Clients applications 
should now do it by themself, or ask the user to do it. This could
also be done by any GuidoLib "installers".
GuidoInit() returns an error code if the font could not be found.

- Windows-dependant code was moved from "GuidoEngine.cpp" to a new 
file "GuidoMainWin32.cpp"

- A wxWindows implementation of "GDevice" is in progress. See 
"GDeviceWx.cpp"

- Global variables "myvariable" have been renamed "gMyVariable", to
	increase code lisibility.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2003-01-21 Stephane Letz <letz@grame.fr>

 The parser code has be cleanup up in the following way:
 
 - library specific part of the guido.cpp file have been removed and moved
 in new files in the corresponding libraries (GUIDOEngine and Guido2Midi).
 The guido.cpp file should now contain only common code.
 
 - new gd_imp_init and gd_imp_exit entry points have been added in the
 guido.h file. Their purpose in to allow library implementation of the
 parser API to have  specific initialization and cleanup code.
 gd_imp_init and gd_imp_exit functions are called in the parser global
 gd_init and gd_exit entry points.
 
 - new files GUIDOEngineParser.cpp (GUIDOEngine library) and
 Gmn2MidiParser.cpp (Gmn2Midi library) have been added.
